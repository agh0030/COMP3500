Project 1 Report

Step 1: Had no issues setting up linux environment, I chose to install CentOS on a virtual machine.

Step 2: I was able to complete testing the script command with no issues as well.
     The file for step 2 is saved in a .script file, named Step2_scripts.script

Step 3: The script log for 3.1 is saved as 'commands.script' within the .tgz file sub		mitted
     	The system attributes described by task 3.2  are stored in the .txt files as according to the project specifications.  I was not sure if it would work correctly if saved in a script file, so I apologize for the inconvenience if that isnt the correct way to submit the information.
	The session for task 3.3 is saved to the script file gcc-gdb.script.
	After creating the .gdbinit file, it had dissapeared and I could not access it fro	m the file explorer. I corrected this by accessing it directly throguh terminal,          using 'emacs .gdbinit' in order to edit the file.
	The scripts for task 3.4 are saved to the script file git.script.  I encountered two problems here, the first being that git diff did not return anything on my console.  The second issue I faced was when uploading my git repository, I could not figure out how to push files in the form of a folder to appear on my repository, and still have not figured that out yet.  It pushes the folder, but the folder cannot be accessed when viewing it on GitHub.

The instructions for how to submit were a little unclear to me, and I believe I have everything required to submit within the compressed file.
If there is anything I am missing, please do let me know and I will do what I can in case I did not submit this project the correct way.
