Project 1 Report

I was able to complete all of the steps required for the project, but ran into a few  issues when completing certain steps.
The first issue I ran into was giving the error "cannot find a valid baseurl for repo" which was fixed by using the command 'sudo dhclient'
After creating the .gdbinit file, it had dissapeared and I could not access it from the file explorer. I corrected this by accessing it directly throguh terminal, using 'emacs .gdbinit' in order to edit the file.

My last issue I faced was when uploading my git repository, I could not figure out how to push files in the form of a folder to appear on my repository, and still have not figured that out yet.  It pushes the folder, but the folder cannot be accessed when viewing it on GitHub.

The instructions for how to submit were a little unclear to me, and I believe I have everything required to submit within the compressed file.
If there is anything I am missing, please do let me know and I will do what I can in case I did not submit this project the correct way.
